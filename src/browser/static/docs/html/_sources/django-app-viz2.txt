viz2 (renamed due to a naming collision) uses Google Charts to visualize the 
results of database queries.

==========
How to use
==========
* Run DataHub

* Navigate to `apps/viz <apps/viz2>`_

* Enter a query

* Choose a visualization type from `this list of Google charts <https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery>`__

* Draw Viz

Ignore the optional viz config for now. It's broken.
