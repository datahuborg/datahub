Description: viz
        ===
        
        Data visualization in the terminal.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        **From PyPI:**
        
        ::
        
            easy_install viz
        
        **From source:**
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/chbrown/viz.git
            cd viz
            python setup.py install
        
        The CLI entry point is ``viz``, which should be installed on your
        ``PATH``.
        
        Commands
        --------
        
        ``viz hist``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Read floats from ``stdin`` and plot as a single line histogram.
        
        **Example**: ping google every 100ms (0.1s) and plot the first 50
        response times you get back:
        
        ::
        
            ping -i 0.1 google.com | head -50 | sed -n 's/.*time=\(.*\) ms/\1/p' | viz hist
        
        Example result (which should fit your terminal width automatically):
        
        ::
        
            26.1390000[▁      ▁▁  ▁▁▂▂ ▉ ▂▂ ▃ ▂▁▂ ▁ ▁▁      ▁   ▁                                    ]39.5580000
        
        ``viz total``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Read floats from ``stdin`` and sum them. No graphics, but useful because
        ``awk '{sum+=$1}END{print sum}`` is too long.
        
        **Example**: count the bytes used by the current directory and its
        children.
        
        ::
        
            find . -ls | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 7 | viz total
        
        Example result:
        
        ::
        
            8519086.0
        
        Compare to du:
        
        ::
        
            echo $[$(du -sk . | cut -f 1) * 1024]
            > 8531968
        
        ``viz points``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Read floats from ``stdin``, plot on a single line from left to right
        with as much granularity as the terminal will allow. Otherwise, bin
        incrementally and plot the arithmetic mean of each bin.
        
        **Example**: ping some really awful website every 100ms, plot the first
        100 successful responses (takes about 10s).
        
        ::
        
            ping -i 0.1 godaddy.com | head -100 | sed -n 's/.*time=\(.*\) ms/\1/p' | viz points
        
        Example result:
        
        ::
        
            [+156.298000]
               ▃▃ ▁▃          ▁ ▁▁ ▁    ▁  ▁▁▁▂ ▃▂ ▉▂              ▁ ▁▁      ▁▂▁       ▁  ▁          ▁      ▁
            [+70.593000]
        
        The top line is the maximum, the bottom is the minimum. The other values
        are scaled linearly between those extremes.
        
        Dependencies:
        -------------
        
        -  ``numpy``
        
        Related projects (mostly graphical visualizations for Python)
        -------------------------------------------------------------
        
        -  `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html>`__: feels
           archaic to the touch. The pyplot fans have never run ``import this``,
           the interface is unguessable and murkily documented.
        -  `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/quickstart.html>`__: haven't used yet
        -  `Vispy <http://vispy.org/>`__: haven't used yet
